# This is a modified version of Chatterbox TTS.

This fork has the following modifications:
1. Accepts a text file as input.
2. Each sentence is processed separately, written to a temp folder, then after all sentences have been written, they are concatenated into a single audio file.
3. Outputs audio files to "outputs" folder.
